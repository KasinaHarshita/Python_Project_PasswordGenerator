We know that all sorts of companies are getting hacked these days. How can we make sure that the hackers don't get to you and your account? How are these hackers being able to get access to this? One of the most commor reason is password reuse. Using the same password on 20 different sites from Google to Facebook, to Skype, to Spotify and other services that we signup to. The problem is when one of these sites get hacked, then the email and password combination used to signup is compromised. All the hacker has to do is to try out the credentials on a bunch of other websites and see if they work. To address this issue, the project was built. 


If you want to know if your email and password are on a database somewhere? You can head over to **https://haveibeenpwned.com/** website and type in your email to see if it was inolved in a website that had been compromised.


In this project, the user has to specify the number of letters, symbols and numbers needed in the password and the algorithm generates a strong password for you which is impossible to crack.
